<h1 id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>Most software companies now
learn their policies via 
  data-driven methods. 
  Modern practitioners  treat every planned feature as an experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments. </p>
<p>This subject will explore
  methods for designing data collection 
  experiments; collecting
  that data; exploring that data;
  then presenting that data in  such a way to support business-level
decision making for software projects.</p>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>Students are expected to gain an insight into the practical difficulties and useful methods
 for collecting, exploring, and presenting
 data  in  such a way to support business-level
decision making for software projects.</p>
<h1 id="course-topics">Course Topics</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background and introduction to software science;</li>
<li>Ethics;</li>
<li>SE for software science (analysis constraints, prototyping analysis methods, managing analysis mining scripts);</li>
<li>Qualitative methods;</li>
<li>Visualization methods;</li>
<li>Data mining;</li>
<li>Multi-goal optimization;</li>
<li>Introductory statistics;</li>
<li>Open issues in software science. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="who-should-attend">Who Should Attend</h1>
<p>This subject offers the background knowledge
needed for graduate students in software engineering.</p>
<p>Industrial data scientists working on
software projects would also find this subject
a useful introduction to the perils and potentials
of data science for software engineering. </p>
<h1 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h1>
<p>No late assignments will be accepted. Many of your assignments will be collaborative effort with other members of your group. Thus, late papers by one member of the group will affect the entire group. The due date for assignments will be posted on the assignment and will generally be submitted electronically.</p>
<h1 id="rules-of-the-road">Rules of the Road</h1>
<p>Unexcused absences from the final exam will result in an F for the course. </p>
<p>The other rule is to have a good time!</p>
<h1 id="for-the-uninitiated">For the Uninitiated</h1>
<p>This course is based on reality, that is, we will try to cover the real world aspects of software engineering. Outside reading and discussions with your classmates is expected.</p>
<p>You will find out that we grade project writeups very carefully. What that translates to is that we expect outstanding work on them and no less. If you do not have a grammar checker, find one! Although this isn’t an English course, we do expect you to know how to write.</p>
<h1 id="teaching-philosophy">Teaching Philosophy</h1>
<p>We will make use of intensive classroom activities and readings. You will be expected to participate actively in discussions. On any given issue, you may be asked to summarize and criticize reading assignments from the text or articles that you have read for your assignments and projects. We view the web as a valuable resource. Our course website will serve as our ”information system” this semester; you will be expected to visit the site on a daily basis for updates and to obtain your homework / project assignments.</p>
<p>Only you can learn. As the instructors, we can only guide and assist you. Thus, all of the class activities are aimed at helping you learn.</p>
<h1 id="writing-style">Writing Style</h1>
<p>All writing assignments are expected to be spell checked and proof read and laid out to professional standards using the Latex
or Word templates at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.</p>
<h1 id="course-grading">Course Grading</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mid term: 30%  </li>
<li>Student homeworks:  6*5% marks (due every 2 weeks)   </li>
<li>Class Participation 10% </li>
<li>Final project: 30% </li>
</ul>
<p>Any unexcused absence from the final exam will result in a grade of 0 for the exam and an F for the course.</p>
<p>Final grades:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1

<h1 id="expected-workload">Expected Workload</h1>
<p>Students must be prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a week to this class (excluding the time spent in the classroom). Laboratory instruction is not included in this subject.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend a review session during their consultation time. There, students may be asked to review code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.</p>
<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. You should be aware of the University policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct.</p>
<p>The exams will be done individually. Academic integrity is important. Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.</p>
<p>Note that cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted.</p>
<h1 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h1>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509, 919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation(REG 02.20.01).</p>
<p>Students are responsible for reviewing the PRRs which pertain to their course rights and responsibilities. These include: http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 (Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination Policy Statement), http://oied.ncsu.edu/oied/policies.php (Office for Institutional Equity and Diversity), http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01 (Code of Student Conduct), and http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03 (Grades and Grade Point Average).</p>
<h1 id="non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</h1>
<p>NC State University provides equality of opportunity in education and employment for all students and employees. Accordingly, NC State affirms its commitment to maintain a work environment for all employees and an academic environment for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Note that, as a lecturer, I am legally required to report all such acts to the campus policy1.
Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's policies and regulations covering discrimination, harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-04-25-05 or http://www.ncsu.edu/equal_op/. Any person who feels that he or she has been the subject of prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should contact the Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) at 919-515-3148.</p>
<h1 id="liability-insurance">Liability Insurance.</h1>
<p>Non-scheduled class time for field trips or out-of-class activities are NOT required for this class. No such trips are currently planned.</p>
<p>However, if they do happen then students are required to purchase liability insurance. For more information, see http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/insurance/.</p>
