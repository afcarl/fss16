## What's Difference

This subject peeks inside data mining for software engineering to
highlight the missing bits: intuitions, insight, verification, reproduction, software maintenance.

We will often _build_ our learners (cause we're software engineers)
  since we want to understand, and improve, what goes on inside these
  software-based machine learning systems.

## Who

You are someone who wants to work in the Big Data industry but you want something
that sets you apart from the rest of the pack. You want to be a leader, someone that can understand
and inspire others while at the same time, seeing options and pitfalls others do not see.
