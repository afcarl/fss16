# Homework4

## Big Project

Write 1 page on what your big project in November. No need to have all the details worked out but
what are the broad strokes?

Note, there are some project ideas at the [projects](projects.md) page, but don't feel bound by them.

## Nearest neighbor

Using your table class, code up a [mini-batch K-means classifier](http://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dsculley/papers/fastkmeans.pdf)  and [KD-trees](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577497-kd-tree-for-nearest-neighbor-search-in-a-k-dimensi/).

+ Compare the runtimes between kNN and KD-trees
+ Compare the performance between kNN and KD-trees (does doing it faster mean doing it wrong?)
