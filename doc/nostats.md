# How Not to do Statistics

![](http://tiny.cc/soonish)

Well, "how not to do stats" is a little bit of a little hyperbolic statement
(not meant to be taken literally, an overly simplistic provocative statement
designed to get the reader's attention).  I do actually like statistics:

- Sometimes, simple parametric statistics are so quick that it can be useful to
  use them as heuristics to guide a search.
- In the following I make extensive use of non-parametric statistics (i.e.
  statistics that make little to no underlying assumptions about the undelying
  distributions).

What I do have issues with, on the other hand, are initial assumptions that the
world can be described as a small number of pre-defined functions; e.g. some
bell-shaped curve where all the numbers line up evenly either size of a single
most likely value.

## First, Visualize

It turns out< i have issues with CHIRP. Not sure 

## Second, Go Non-Parametric
