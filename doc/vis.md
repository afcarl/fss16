# Visualizations

Papers containing _"N"_ visualizations contain at least three types:

- Expositional: illustrations or elaborations of some point;
- Conclusive: pictures that lead to some conclusion;
- Silly:  pointless, waste of ink

## Conclusive

Conclusive
explanations are an inference procedure that must be tuned to:

- the goals of the inference
- the background knowledge of the inference.

So when we do visualizations, what are the tricks to add in
"the story" to the picture? There is no easy, or short, answer
this question. So we will ask another question:

- Given a visualization, what change could be made to make
  the explanation worse/better?

In the following, we apply this test to _"N"_ visualizations
to reverse engineering a list of useful operators for improving
visualizations.
