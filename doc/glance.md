# At a Glance


Class Number: 12163  
We 6:00PM - 8:45PM  
EE1. 1005  

## What

Most software companies now learn their policies via data-driven
methods. Modern practitioners treat every planned feature as an
experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key
performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the
progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color
of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments.

This subject will explore methods for designing data collection
experiments; collecting that data; exploring that data; then
presenting that data in such a way to support business-level decision
making for software projects.

- In this class, we will often _build_ our learners (cause we're software engineers)
  since we want to understand, and improve, what goes on inside these
  software-based machine learning systems.
- You can code in  any language you like, but I can only support your
work in Python.
- All the code here _will_ run on LINUX on a _cloud9_ account,
  _may_ run on Macintosh and no promises are made about other platforms.
