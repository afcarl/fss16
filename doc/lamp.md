Assumption:

+ Data mining is unnecessary. Wrong. Be as qualitative as
  your like, do everything you want to collect sane
  data. You'll still have data which you can misintepret in a
  1000 ways unless you
+ Data mining is optional. Wrong. You seen the volume of
  data out there? _Some_ automation is essential.
+ Data mining is inferior to human insight. Wrong, sometimes. 
  You seen the messes people can make with their reasoning?
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases. So people can
  be wrong, sometimes, just like looking at data with data miners can be wrong,
  sometimes.
