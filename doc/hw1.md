## Before you begin


Get your Github environment going (public github, not ncstate). Add `timm` and
`bigfatnoob`
as collaborators  to that repo.

Get your development environment going. This should be code that is checked into git
and saved, regularly to your Gibhub account, and shared with any team members.

For your project, pick a development language. Use anything you want but be aware that
the lecturer and tutor can only support students using
Python on LINUX and Mac. Note also that all your team members should agree on the language.

Review your team. Ideally, a team should contain at least one moderate expert
in what ever language you are using. Got to http://tiny.cc/fss2016give and check out
our random assignments to the teams. Ask for a change if NO ONE on your team is
expert on the language you are using. If you make a change:

- mark your people with the same letter in column C, BELOW Row 20
- add your Gibub url in column B ABOVE row 20
