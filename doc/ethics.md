# Ethics

"Software engineers generate options faster than society can recognize,  faster than lawyers can understand, and faster than courts can react. While everyone else catches up, it will be up to use to fret and worry and decide what options are (are not) imposed on society. And understand this-- when the world does catch up, they may question, condone, even prosecute those decisions."   
-- timm

Before we begin (from the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics):

+ We believe there are unavoidable ethical dilemmas in each role of life.
+ We believe a practical ethical decision-making framework improves ethical outcomes.
+ We believe ethics should are an active concern for the poor and marginalized.
+ We believe people need a source of informed guidance on ethical dilemmas and ethical decision making.
+ We believe   ethical behavior requires information, preparation, personal reflection.
+ We believe there are organizational ethical cultures and that they can be managed by creating effective structures, incentives, and communications.
+ We believe healthy ethical environments help organizations endure.
 institutional leaders have a critical role in creating, sustaining ethical cultures.
+ We believe individuals must demonstrate personal leadership to make good ethical choices, to strengthen ethical culture of organizations, and to lead an ethical life.
+ We believe in civility when exploring ethical dilemmas (even when complex and contested)

The last point is very important. The next hour many challenge you, a lot. And your colleagues in this
room. Support each other.

## The Case of the Hidden Assumption

"It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter." - Nathaniel Borenstein

+  [The sad case of the small tomato farmer](http://www.boomcalifornia.com/2013/06/thinking-through-the-tomato-harvester/)
+ [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanised_agriculture#Tomato_harvesting): To withstand the rigor of the machines, new crop varieties were bred to match the automated pickers. UC Davis Professor G.C. Hanna propagated a thick-skinned tomato called VF-145. But even still, millions were damaged with impact cracks and university breeders produced a more tougher and juiceless “square round” tomato. Small farms were of insufficient size to obtain financing to purchase the equipment and within 10 years, 85% of the state's 4,000 cannery tomato farmers were out of the business. This led to a concentrated tomato industry in California that “now packed 85% of the nation’s tomato products”. The monoculture fields fostered rapid pest growth, requiring the use of “more than four million pounds of pesticides each year” which greatly affected the health of the soil, the farm workers, and possibly the consumers.[21]_
