# Syllabus


![fss16](https://fss16.slack.com/)

NcState, ComSci   
Fall 2016   
Class 111691 (500-level), 12163 (700-level)   
EE I, Roon 1005,  
Wednesday, 6 to 8:45pm

### Overview

**Synopsis:**
Many software companies now learn their policies via data-driven
methods. Modern practitioners treat every planned feature as an
experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key
performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the
progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color
of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments.

This subject will explore methods for designing data collection
experiments; collecting that data; exploring that data; then
presenting that data in such a way to support business-level decision
making for software projects.

**Objectives:** By the end of the course, students should be able to:
 
+ Read and understand the state of the art in research on software science;
+ Analyze and critique core principles of software science;
+ Build and run software that  execute those core principles. 
+ Predict and explain and optimize the behavior of those models.
+ Build and evaluate software science tools.
+ Analyze, critique, and communicate clearly the software science

+ Office Hours: Wednesday, 3:00-5:00 and by request
+ Location of Office Hours: EE II room 3298 
+ E-Mail: tim.menzies@gmail.com 
  + Only use this email for private matters. All other class communication should be via the class Slack channels,    listed below.
+ Phone: 304-376-2859
       + **Do not use** this number, except in the most dire of 
          circumstances (best way to contact me is via email).

**Group mailing list:** During term time, all communication will be via the Slack channel
[https://fss16.slack.com/messages](https://fss16.slack.com). Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their questions and answers to that shared resource.
+ Note that, for communication of a more private nature, contact the lecturer on the email shown above.

**Topics:** What is software science? Differences to data science?  Tools (data
miners). Methods (visualizations, statistics). Verification methods
(reproduction packages). Ethics. Tutorials on scripting.



**Project:** Students will implement and reason about some SE data
of their own choosing. Note that:

+ CSC 791 Ph.d. student will tackle a more intricate task;
+ CSC 591 masters students will work in groups of two to achieve a somewhat less
intricate goals.

**Prerequisite:** Note that this is a
**programming-intensive** subject. A programming
background is required in a contemporary language
such as Java or C/C++ or Python.  Significant software industry
experience may be substituted, at the instructorâ€™s
discretion.  Students in this class will work in
Python, but no background knowledge of that language
will be assumed.

**Suggested texts:** (optional)
  [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)

+ Note: for low-level systems reasons, we will use
  Python 2.7 for this subject. So do not get the
  absolute latest version of this book.

**Expected Workload:** 
Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend a review session during their consultation  time. There, students may be asked to review
code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.

Also, this is tools-based subject
and it is required that students learn and use those
tools (Python, repositories, etc).  Students MUST be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
classroom). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject (but the first three weeks will be
spent on some in-depth programming tutorials). Note
that the workload for masters and Ph.D. students
will be different (see above).

**Grading:** The following grade scale will be used: 

+ A+  (97-100), A (93-96), A-(90-92)
+ B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82)
+ C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-(70-72)
+ D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-(60-62)
+ F (below 60).

Grades will be added together using:

+ Homeworks : 24 = 8 * 3
+ Mid-term/final exam: 10/21
+ Paper (on the software science): 15
+ Big project (on software s): 23 (essay) 7 (presentation)

The mid-term exam will be held on Tuesday October 18 


The final exam will be held on Wednesday  December 14
during class time [check](https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/calendars/exam/).



### Homeworks 

+ All deliverables are group-based (one deliverable per group)
  + 591 students: groups of three
  + 791 students: groups of one
+ Homeworks will be written into a public Github repo which students will create.
+ Students will shorten the url (using something like tiny.cc) of the the main file of each homework submission
    + That url wull be pasted into the spreadsheet [http://tiny.cc/fss2016give](http://tiny.cc/fss2016give)
+ Homeworks will be of two forms:
    + Coding: worth 2 marks (and marked 0,1,2)
    + Reading: with 1 mark
+ Students cannot do homework <em>i+1</em> till  homework <em>i</em> get full marks.
+ Homeworks can be submitted multiple times
  + No late penalties
  + No points taken off for repeat submissions
  + We will not mark more than four (coding) homeworks plus four (lit review) homeworks per month.
+ Students must submit (or resubmit) at least one item per week (or lose 2 marks)


### Attendance


Attendance is extremely important for your learning
experience in this class. Once you reach three
unexcused absences, each additional absence will
reduce your attendance grade by 10%.

Except for officially allowed reasons, your presence in the class if required from day one. 
Late-comers will have to work in their own solo groups (to avoid disruptions to existing groups).

Note that absences for weddings (your own, or someone else's, is not an offically allowed reason).

Exceptions: this subject  will support students who are absent for any of the following
officially allowed reasons:

- Anticipated Absences (cleared with the instructor before the absence).
Examples of anticipated situations include
    - representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team;
    - required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court;
    - religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA).
    - Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses must be reported to the instructor not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
      -  Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
      -  Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.  An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs.

That support will include changing the schedule of deliverables and/or (in extreme
case) different grading arrangements.


### Academic Integrity

Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagerism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:

+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.

Students are encouraged to read each others code and repor **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:

+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.

All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.
 
The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.  

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students
with verifiable disabilities. In order to take
advantage of available accommodations, students must
register with Disability Services for Students at
1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509,
919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's
policy on working with students with disabilities,
please see the Academic Accommodations for Students
with Disabilities Regulation(REG 02.20.01).

religion, creed, sex, national origin, age,
disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is
a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State
University policy and will not be
tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the
form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile
environment) based on race, color, religion, creed,
sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of
state and federal law and/or NC State University
policy and will not be tolerated.

+ Note that, as a lecturer, I am legally required to
  **report** all such acts to the campus policy.

Retaliation
against any person who complains about
discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's
