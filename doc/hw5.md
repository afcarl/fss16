# Homework5


## Bayes Classifer

Using your table class, code up a Bayes classifier
that assumes numerics are modeling as Gaussians.

Integrate it into dotninjas so you can get the stats reports.


Your task:

+ Compare the runtimes between your fastest knn device (from last week)
and NaiveBayes.
+ Compare the performance between Bayes and your
fastest KNN device  (does doing it faster mean doing it wrong?)
