# Correlation is Not Causation?

![](http://tiny.cc/soonish)

Standard dismissive remark when  discount the results of a data mining study:

+ "Just because the data miner finds a connection between this and that..."
+ "... does not mean that connection actually exists..."
+ "... since correlation is not causation"

Well:

- Should not say that. its a very bad mantra that killed a lot of people (smoking)
- "Correlation" here is often use as a catch all phrase  that encompasses all statistical/ data mining methods.
- Much more to data mining that "correlation"

What is correlation anyway?

- Forumalae
- Useful, I would say if combined with other visualizations (see scatter plots)
- Misleading, otherwise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#/media/File:Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg
- Lesson: do stats after visualizations.
