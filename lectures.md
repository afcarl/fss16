## Exploring the Premises

No unifying theory

+ Counter case "unifying theories of software
  engineering". Much research, including my one work
  on abduction. Rejected by numerous conferences/journals.
  Not operational. Countercase: Whitehead's power laws

## Data Mining 101

Gentle walk through N learners

## Maths 101

bias, variance: basic laws 

entropy,

effect size, 

dimensionality

boostrap sampling

Based on a Scientific research paper here is top 10
data mining algorithms identified by the IEEE
International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in
December 2006 and these top 10 algorithms are among
the most influential data mining algorithms in the
research community

## The Process

Sanity Cycles

KDD cycles. From 1994

Goal Cycles

- find someone's hypothesis, that they care about
- find what feature extractors are needed
- consider if you need old vs new data
    - some new data as a sanity check
    - but generally, more old than new data (exception: Mechanical Turk)
    - consider the use of surrogates (stand-ins for what you might want)
    - e.g. surrogate: "happiness" = rate at which folks quit
