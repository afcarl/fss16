Most software companies now learn their policies via
data-driven methods. Modern practitioners treat
every planned feature as an experiment, of which
only a few are expected to survive. Key performance
metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to
judge the progress of a feature. Even simple design
decisions such as the color of a link are chosen by
the outcome of software experiments.

This subject will explore methods for designing data
collection experiments; collecting that data;
exploring that data; then presenting that data in
such a way to support business-level decision making
for software projects.
